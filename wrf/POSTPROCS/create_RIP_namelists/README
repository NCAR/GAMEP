***ALL NECESSARY SCRIPTS AND FILES****
**************************************
All files in this folder can be checked out from CVS in the following path:
cvs/apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/scripts/postprocs/create_RIP_namelists
These files should be:
create_plots.csh              - Wrapper script to make all namelists
create_RIP.ncl                - Primary program used to make namelists
plotting_routines.ncl         - Contains all the user functions for create_RIP.ncl
create_color_table_images.ncl - Makes color table images for all possible color tables used in the plots
                              - The resultant color table images should then be copied to .../www/htdocs/rip/

**************************************
******STEPS IN RUNNING SCRIPTS********
**************************************
1) Go to: http://smac-c2-int1/cgi-bin/rip/enter_rip_form.pl and select a range
   Note: All web form files are also in CVS at cvs/apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/scripts/postprocs/create_RIP_namelists/www/cgi-bin/rip/ and .../www/htdocs/rip/
   The web form files were created by Becky Ruttenburg (becky@ucar.edu)
2) Select the range-specific plots and plotting parameters and submit the form
3) Copy the coded output into a file called formRANGE.out and put it in the create_RIP_namelists directory
   RANGE is the 3- or 4-letter range id (e.g., DPG)
   Contents of this file are explained in greater detail in *formRANGE.out DETAILS* section below
4) In create_plots.csh, edit range, domain and season
   Note: Namelists will be created for all seasons and domains for the given range
         Setting the domain and season is only for viewing those plots
5) In create_RIP.ncl, set variable "testing" to 1 for testing, or 0 for operational
6) Run create_plots.csh and the namelists should be created
