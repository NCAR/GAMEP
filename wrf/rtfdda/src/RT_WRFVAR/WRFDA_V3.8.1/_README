29-JUN-2017             Building WRFVAR 3.8.1 for RTFDDA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependencies:

 (1) WRFVAR 3 does not depend on WRF being compiled.

For RTFDDA

 (1) Need to remove all the CVS dirs before doing ./compile. There are
     link failures in the ./compile with commands like: "ln -s ../*"

 (2) Need to add a _Makefile.auto_build to this directory

 (3) Need to modify the Makefile for the following libraries
     to change all instances of TARGET to LIB_TARGET so doesn't 
     get overridden by the Makefile at the apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/src level.

     Modify file: apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/src/RT_WRFVAR/WRFDA_3.8.1/external/fftpack/fftpack5/Makefile

     Modify file: apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/src/RT_WRFVAR/WRFDA_3.8.1/var/external/bufr/Makefile

     Modify file: apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/src/RT_WRFVAR/WRFDA_3.8.1/external/io_esmf/makefile

     Modify file: apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/src/RT_WRFVAR/WRFDA_3.8.1/external/atm_ocn/Makefile


 (4) Need to add install of libbufr.a (if created, may need to have env
     var "BUFR" set to 1) to shared lib area. This lib is required by
     apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/src/hybrid/tools/ncep_radiance/cwordsh_source

 (5) Starting WRFDA_3.5.1 (maybe even earlier), the source codes comes with
     two required empty directories: var/build/{frame,inc}. Since empty
     directories cannot be CVS tagged, they cannot be checked out from CVS
     with the intended tag. A solution is add a README file to each of these
     directories, check them into the CVS, so that these directories can be
     tagged and subsequently checked out from a tag.
