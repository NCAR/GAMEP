28-JUN-2017		Building WRFv3.8.1 for RTFDDA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0) This version in RAL's terminology is RAL3.8.1R0+

1) Need to modify the Makefile for libfftpack.a to change all instances
   of TARGET to LIB_TARGET so doesn't get overridden by the Makefile at 
   the apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/src level.

   Modify file: apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/src/RT_WRF/WRF_V3.8.1/external/fftpack/fftpack5/Makefile

   to change all instances of TARGET to LIB_TARGET

2) Need to modify the makefile for libio_esmf.a to change all instances
   of TARGET to LIB_TARGET so doesn't get overridden by the Makefile at 
   the apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/src level.

   Modify file: apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/src/RT_WRF/WRF_V3.8.1/external/io_esmf/makefile

   to change all instances of TARGET to LIB_TARGET

3) Need to modify the Makefile for libatm_ocn.a to change all instances
   of TARGET to LIB_TARGET so doesn't get overridden by the Makefile at 
   the apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/src level.

   Modify file: apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/src/RT_WRF/WRF_V3.8.1/external/atm_ocn/Makefile

   to change all instances of TARGET to LIB_TARGET

4) Need to add a _Makefile.auto_build to the apps/4dwx/RTFDDA/src/RT_WRF/WRF_V3.8.1/
   directory
